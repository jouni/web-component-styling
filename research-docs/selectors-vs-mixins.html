  <h2>Exposing component state for theming</h2>

  <p>In order to avoid the mental model issues that mixins incur – the fact
    that they offer no cascade – it would be easier for developers to have
    explicit mixins for each different state. But this quickly results in
    a huge number of mixins to expose and maintain, which is not great for
    us. So it would be better to just have one mixin per each sub-part of a
    component.</p>

  <p>In this example, we are overriding the background color in both states,
    but text color only in the "clicked" state. The "button component" has one
    sub-part and exposes two mixins for it, one for the default state
    (<code>--test-mixin</code>) and one for the toggled/clicked state
    (<code>--test-state-mixin</code>).</p>

  <custom-style>
    <style>
      .selectors:not(.fixed) {
        --test-mixin: {
          color: white;
          background-color: blue;
        }
      }

      .selectors:not(.fixed).state-for-selectors {
        --test-mixin: {
          background-color: green;
        }
      }

      .mixins {
        --test-mixin: {
          color: white;
          background-color: blue;
        }
        --test-state-mixin: {
          background-color: green;
        }
      }
    </style>
  </custom-style>

  <pre>
    /* Using state-dependent mixins */

    button {
      --test-mixin: {
        color: white;
        background-color: blue;
      }
      --test-state-mixin: {
        background-color: green;
      }
    }

    /* Using just one set of mixins and selectors for state */

    button {
      --test-mixin: {
        color: white;
        background-color: blue;
      }
    }

    button[state] {
      --test-mixin: {
        background-color: green;
      }
    }
  </pre>

  <simple-element class="selectors"><span>Click me – my text color is <b>unexpected</b></span></simple-element>
  <simple-element class="mixins"><span>Click me – my text color is <b>expected</b></span></simple-element>

  <p>When using separate mixins for both states, everything works as expected.
    But when using selectors, the mixin declaration for the state overrides
    all of the properties set by the default state, which could be somewhat
    unexpected for a CSS developer who is not that familiar with mixins yet.</p>

  <p>The solution is to create a shared styles mixin for those properties
    that should stay the same between states, and apply that to each state
    explicitly.</p>

  <custom-style>
    <style>
      .selectors.fixed {
        --shared-styles: {
          color: white;
        }

        --test-mixin: {
          @apply --shared-styles;
          background-color: blue;
        }
      }

      .selectors.fixed.state-for-selectors {
        --test-mixin: {
          @apply --shared-styles;
          background-color: green;
        }
      }
    </style>
  </custom-style>

  <pre>
    button {
      --shared-styles: {
        color: white;
      }

      --test-mixin: {
        @apply --shared-styles;
        background-color: blue;
      }
    }

    button[state] {
      --test-mixin: {
        @apply --shared-styles;
        background-color: green;
      }
    }
  </pre>

  <simple-element class="selectors fixed"><span>Click me – my text color is <b>expected</b></span></simple-element>

  <p>The downside of this solution is that it increases the number of CSS
    declarations on the page (number of properties in the shared styles
    times the number of additional states).</p>

  <p>The upside of this approach is that the number of mixins is manageable,
    and the selectors are more flexible for our themes (because of the exposed
    state in the host element).</p>

  <h3>But selectors won’t pierce the shadow DOM boundary?</h3>

  <p>We don’t consider this as a limitation, but rather as a feature, making the
    use of themes more explicit. This way, the developer explicitly opts-in to
    using the themes they wish inside each shadow DOM.</p>

  <p>We still provide high level CSS custom properties and component mixins to
    customize the themes, but any complex customizations do not automatically
    apply cross shadow boundaries. To apply complex customizations to all
    component instances across all shadow boundaries, the developer needs to
    package those customizations in a new style module and explicitly import
    and include it in all shadow roots.</p>

  <p>We also avoid introducing unnecessary API with this (high number of
    state-dependent mixins), and keep our styling API more future-proof, as it
    looks we will get better CSS features to cover the styling/theming use case
    in the future in the form of
    <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/300#issuecomment-276210974">
    shadow-piercing custom pseudo class selectors</a>. It is easy for us to then
    change our themes so that they utilize those features and open up more
    possibilies for global theming for the developer without breaking that much
    existing API (we might just replace the sub-part mixins with custom pseudo
    classes).</p>
